# Uniform Probability Distribution

### Task

Write a function for calculating continuous uniform probability distributions.

### Continuous Uniform Distribution

The function has four inputs:
* `low_range` representing the first variable of interest
* `high_range` representing the second variable
* `minimum` representing the minimum value of the distribution
* `maximum` representing the maximum value of the distribution

The output should be the probability that the variable lies between low_range and high_range.

Assume low_range < high_range.
